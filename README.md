# ReReact: Simple Meta-Framework for React

## What ReReact will be

- Convenient (like [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com))
- Simple
- With right levels of abstraction - aka little magic
- With cutting edge technologies: [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) as bundler and [Happy-Dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) for node
- With minimal dependencies
